3. Impressions

The data are not appear so natural and the usability in an actual system might be low because of these reasons:

The user queries cover a diverse range of topics, and the system responses 
appear to be generated by an automated system with limited context understanding. 

The difficulty for a machine learning model to learn from this dataset is limited because of the complexity of the underlying patterns 
and the diversity of language used. The dataset i used lacks of variation and the system appears to response with the same stracture
(eg I am not able to know, i do not know)as a result it may limit the model's generalization capabilities.
Additionally, the absence of labeled intent or action categories could reduce the complexity of the system.
