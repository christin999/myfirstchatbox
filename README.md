I worked on 3 Chat boxes : 
o	The first one is for finding the top restaurants in the world
o	The second one is for searching music depends on genre 
o	The third one is for the weather depends on location

I have made the specific choices of Chat boxes in order to provide useful and basic information through links to the user,  simplifying their lives.

I would like the chat box to be capable of understanding every day needs of the user and to be able to make life easier. Chat box must be trained to make more complicated and specified actions.
